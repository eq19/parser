# Electroweak Theory (parser)

Establishment theoretical framework as _[the standard theory](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13931443/The_Standard_Model_of_Electroweak_Interactions.pdf)_ of electroweak interactions: Higgs searches, quark mixing, neutrino oscillations.

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

Gauge invariance is a powerful tool to determine the dynamical forces. Particle content, structure and symmetries of Lagrangian are discussed. 

## Standard Theory

```note
***The Higgs and the electromagnetic field have no effect on each other***, at the level of the fundamental forces ("tree level"), while any other combination of the hypercharge and the weak isospin must interact with the Higgs. ***This causes an apparent separation between the weak force, which interacts with the Higgs, and electromagnetism, which does not***. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction#Formulation))_

Experiments have verified that the weak and electromagnetic force become identical at very small distances and provide the GUT description of the carrier particles for the forces.

## Symmetry Breaking

```note
The pattern of [weak isospin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_isospin), T3, and [weak hypercharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_hypercharge), YW, of the known elementary particles, showing electric charge along the [weak mixing angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinberg_angle). The four components of the Higgs field (squares) break the electroweak symmetry and interact with other particles to give them mass, with three components becoming part of the massive W and Z bosons. Allowed decays of the neutral Higgs boson, H, (circled) satisfy electroweak charge conservation. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction))_

## Problem

```note
Consider the following contradiction in the electroweak theory of the Standard Model.

The electroweak theory of neutrino interaction uses factors like  in order to account for a complete parity violation. This factor implies a massless neutrino [1]: “Nature had the choice of an aesthetically satisfying, but a left-right, symmetry violating theory, with a neutrino which travels exactly with the same velocity of light; or alternatively a theory where left-right symmetry is preserved, but the neutrino has a tiny mass – some ten thousand times smaller than the mass of the electron.”
The neutrino masslessness is also stated by other authors. A review article on neutrino properties states that “two-components left-handed massless neutrino fields play a crucial role in the determination of the charged current structure of the Standard Model” (see the Abstract of [2]). Similarly, a Quantum Field Theory textbook states: “Thus, massless neutrinos are a prediction of the Standard Model” (see [4], p. 555). Indeed, a massless neutrino is the basis for the two-component Weyl neutrino, which shows parity violation (see e.g. section 2.2 of [2]). The same argument appears on p. 139 of [3].

On the other hand, a recent review article negates the foregoing ides and states that it is now admitted “that neutrinos can no longer be considered as massless particles” (see [5], p. 1307). This statement is adopted by the Particle Data Group [6], which is the authorized organization for the definition of reliable particle data. The recognition of this fact by the community was demonstrated by the 2015 Nobel Prize, awarded to the persons who have discovered this property [7].
It follows that the experimentally confirmed massive neutrino undermines the basis of the Standard Model electroweak theory, since the massless neutrino is a crucial element in this theory.

Research topic: Can the validity of the electroweak theory be restored?

Remark: Further  contradictions are discussed in [8]. _([Research Topics](https://oprassn.org/a-problem-in-the-electroweak-theory/))_

How do you resolve Maxwell equations as euler-lagrange equation without electromagnetic electromagnetism, lagrangian formalism, field theory, Maxwell equations, variational principle potential.

```note
Axial (e-e rES repulsions blue aggregating to black axial outward, vs weak axial inward) to generate the Bose “cylinder surface” proof of statistical mechanics.
- Axial View of one hemisphere set of one subshell (N,1,many,-1/2) quantum number example below:
- That gives the path from Planck strength to the Maxwell strengths. Those are not independent, but all based upon h (or h-hat*c version in this case).
- Yes, I used Euler to get there! The weakness of the Lagrangian is that introduces errors in (a0/re)N scaling ^2 vs ^3 (extra 1/r wrongly called angular momentum by Bohr) that introduces an error correction. Hence, circling back to QED methods of error-correction (loops, re-normalization).

So, in the end, you do need. But the path can get similar when you move off arbitration x,y,z or X1,X2,X3 frame-of-reference to the quantitized hemispherical coordinates of the quantum numbers understood as (r#,theta#,phi#,z#).

## Mobius Strip

There are some mathematical shape of this residual objects. [Torus](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#the-crank-of-a-partition) is basically a donut shape, which has the property of of having variable Gaussian curvature. 

```note
The blue parts of the torus above have positive curvature, the red parts negative and the top grey band has zero curvature.  If our 3 dimensional space was like the surface areas of a 4 dimensional torus, the parts would have different angle sums.
```

[![Torus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/228750971-14bb5e2a-5cc7-4b18-9d97-d77401deb55e.png)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#the-crank-of-a-partition)

Some parts of the surface has positive curvature, others zero, others negative.

If you start anywhere on its surface and follow the curvature round you will eventually return to the same place having travelled on every part of the surface.

Mobius strip only has one side, there are two more bizarre shapes with strange properties. 

## The Klein bottle 

The Klein bottleis in someways a 3D version of the Mobius strip and even though it exists in 3 dimensions, to make a true one you need to “fold through” the 4th dimension.

```note
In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the Klein bottle ([/ˈklaɪn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) is an example of a [non-orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability) [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)); that is, informally, a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down.
- More formally, the Klein bottle is a [two-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-dimensional) [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold) on which one cannot define a [normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_vector) at each point that varies [continuously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function) over the whole manifold.
- Other related non-orientable surfaces include the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip) and the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane). 

While a Möbius strip is a surface with a [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology)), a Klein bottle has no boundary. For comparison, a [sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere) is an orientable surface with no boundary.

## The Spinors

A spinor associated to the conformal group of the circle, exhibiting a sign inversion on a full rotation of the circle through an angle of 2π.

```tip
This behaviour finaly brings us to a suggestion that the dimension in string theory are linked with ***the prime distribution level*** as indicated by the _[self repetition](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#self-repetition)_ on MEC30.
```

***7th spin - 4th spin = (168 - 102)s = 66s = 6 x 11s = 30s + 36s***

This model may explains the newly discovered prime number theorem in relatively simple layman's terms for anyone with a slight background in theoretical physics. 

```note
The property gives an in depth analysis of the not so random distribution of primes by showing how it has solved Goldbach's conjecture and the Ulam spiral.
```

The model suggests a possible origin for both charge and half-integer spin and also reconciles the apparently contradictory criteria discussed above.

Under certain conditions, energy could not take on any indiscriminate value, the energy must be some multiple of a very small quantity (later to be known as a ***quantum***).
